We want to start the framework when we feel like it, that means running pygame.init() and such.
So we need an init method here as well. (Or maybe something more aking to run()).

We want the framework to handle all the drawing for us and the main program to take care of the physics and actions.
May want to reorganize this at a later date for the main to only handle data transfer between parts.

The only problem now is how we want to handle the keyboard.
Eventualy we will only want to select the parameters of learning and the learning algorithm and maybe handle 
the data for the visualization (only through the data transfer side).
